# Real-time learning and segmentation
This is our proposed solution for the lab ["Real-time learning and segmentation"][repo] in the computer vision course [TEK5030] at the University of Oslo.

Please see the [lab guide] for more information.

## Prerequisites
- OpenCV must be installed on your system. If you are on a lab computer, you are all set.

  If you are on Ubuntu, but not on a lab computer, the following should be sufficient _for this lab_.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libopencv-dev
   ```

- We refer to [setup_scripts] and [the intro lab] as a general getting started-guide for the C++ labs on Ubuntu 22.04.
